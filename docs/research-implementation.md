# Research-Based Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines how the Pivot-and-Launch PBL Toolkit has been reshaped based on the comprehensive research report. The implementation follows cognitive load theory, transfer research, and evidence-based pedagogical design principles.

## Key Research Insights Implemented

### 1. Cognitive Load Theory Integration

**Research Foundation:** Sweller's cognitive load theory and Paas/Leppink measurement scales

**Implementation:**
- **Pivot Cards:** Structured to minimize extraneous load while building robust schemas
- **Worked Examples:** Progressive guidance fading (worked examples → completion problems → independent projects)
- **Load Monitoring:** Real-time tracking using Paas 1-9 mental effort scale and Leppink multidimensional measures

### 2. Transfer-Focused Launch Design

**Research Foundation:** Barnett & Ceci transfer framework

**Implementation:**
- **Progressive Context Variation:** Near → moderate → far transfer through Launch phases
- **Context Dimensions:** Systematic manipulation of stakeholders, data regimes, constraints, risk, and regulation
- **Transfer Scaffolding:** High support early, progressive fade to independence

### 3. Information Overload Mitigation

**Research Foundation:** Graf & Antoni overload studies, Ragu-Nathan technostress research

**Implementation:**
- **Attention Budgeting:** Time-boxed focus sprints with interruption shields
- **Information Triage:** Source quality heuristics, sufficiency thresholds, decision stop rules
- **Overload Analytics:** Real-time monitoring of cognitive strain indicators

## New Platform Components

### Pivot Assets Module (`/pivot-assets`)

**Purpose:** Implement research-based core knowledge anchoring

**Features:**
- **Pivot Cards:** Canonical representations with definition, constraints, examples, counterexamples, misconceptions
- **Worked Examples Library:** Step-by-step exemplars with self-explanation prompts and completion problems

### Cognitive Load Analytics (`/cognitive-load-analytics`)

**Purpose:** Research-grade monitoring and optimization of learning conditions

**Measurement Framework:**
- **Paas Mental Effort Scale:** Single-item 1-9 rating

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Anchor Before Apply
Every Launch phase explicitly references Pivot artifacts to stabilize mental schemas before contextual application.

### 2. Progressive Guidance Fading
- **High scaffolding:** Worked examples with step-by-step guidance
- **Medium scaffolding:** Completion problems with partial structure
- **Low scaffolding:** Independent projects with minimal support

### 3. Load-Aware Materials
- Content segmentation to manage working memory
- Dual coding (visual + verbal) implementation
- Split-attention elimination in interface design
- Redundancy removal in instructional materials

### 4. Retrieval and Spacing
- Short, frequent, low-stakes assessment
- Automated spaced repetition scheduling
- Spiraled revisit of core concepts across Launch phases

### 5. Information Triage & Attention Budgets
- Source quality evaluation frameworks
- Sufficiency criteria for information gathering
- Micro-deadlines and sprint-based work
- Interruption shields during focus periods

### 6. Constructive Alignment
- Learning outcomes explicitly mapped to assessments
- Activities aligned with both Pivot mastery and Launch transfer
- Assessment rubrics covering both knowledge retention and application
